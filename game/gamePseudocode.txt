functional elements:
cup variable
player variable

cups fall from top in random sequence
repeat sequence from the top after it passes the bottom of the screen
as time passes the speed of the falling cups increases

player moves from left to right to avoid falling cups - no arrow keys on mobile
- think of alternative - use mouse position

if the cups hit the player, game over
after game over:
    -note score
    -compare high score
    - pop up to say "play again" or "exit game"
      - on click "play again" resets the game to start
      - on click "exit game" moves page to next section - Call to action?

visual elements: - can use a jpeg

to do:
essential:
- change background to match the rest of the website
- correct cups so they only disappear once they are off the screen
- add logos and lids to the Cups

- correct the checkCollisions - sizing of the sheep
- is it possible to make the sheep one piece? (like merge layers in photoshop) to avoid splitting error? (see screenshot)
- create pop up to say "play again" and "exit game"
  - create "play again" onclick function to reset the game
  - create "exit game" onclick function to move to next part of website.

if time:

- score function and high score comparison function
- display score and high score on "play again/exit game" pop up
- increase speed/ frequency of falling Cups - start with 4? increase to 8?
